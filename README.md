# Data-Visualization-Project

Data Visualization Project about obesity levels in Canada. The project examines the obesity data over a period of years in the provinces of Canada and provide useful visualization for the user to use and can be viewed at http://www.cs.mun.ca/~mmh623/cs4767project/ . In this project I learned how to manipulate data and use the the D3.js library to create interactive visualizations.
